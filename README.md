# WoojerArmaExtension
Feel the shots in Arma 3 thanks to [Woojer](https://www.woojer.com/)

Connect your Woojer to your PC using USB, but do not set it as default sound device. Let Arma 3 play sounds on your regular device. 

Extension will plays specific sounds to Woojer sound device to make you "feel" your shots.

This is only a proof of concept.

Tested against the Woojer vest only.
